        Our team consists of one programmer (Josh) one artist (also Josh) and one level designer (Josh as well) with a combined total of 3 years of armature game dev experience. As a solo game developer living in his mother’s basement Josh has a strong passion for games and game development. He started playing role playing games all the way back in 1996 with his first game boy playing Zelda, ever since then Josh has loved video games. Then in 2019 at the start of the pandemic Josh discovered the game engine Unity and began to learn how to code in C#, however his game journey never really took off until he began to have school assignments where he started to realize he could hit two birds with one stone by starting up a website based off a game he has always wanted to make. This brings us to now where Josh created this web site to help continue his passion of games development as well as involve and create a community to read, learn, and support this creative process.

        Our game is a top down 2D role playing game based in space. The earth was destroyed a hundred years ago and what remains of the last of humanity drifts in space in fleets of space ships that have replaced the urban cities. Society among the space fleet is in a constant need of survival with each ship playing a different role to contributing to the fleet’s survival. You play as the new comer to the fleet that was left behind as earth was being destroy over a hundred years ago, however you found a way to cryogenically freeze and lunch your self into space. Being pick up by the fleet over a century later your story begins as you awake once more in this post dystopian era.
